-👋 Hi there! I’m @Adesewa-Ajibade, and I'm on an exciting journey into the world of data analysis!

- 👀 I’m passionate about turning data into stories that drive decisions. Whether it's through Excel magic, querying with SQL, or creating stunning dashboards in Power BI, I love uncovering insights that matter.
- 🌱 Right now, I’m diving deep into the fundamentals of data analysis. Every formula, every query, and every visual feels like a new adventure, and I’m eager to learn as much as I can!
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate with fellow data enthusiasts on projects that challenge the norm and explore innovative ways to visualize and interpret data. Let’s create something amazing together!
- 📫 Want to connect? You can reach me at [adesewajibade25@gmail.com ] or find me on LinkedIn at [www.linkedin.com/in/adesewa-ajibade]. I’d love to chat!
- 😄 Pronouns: she/her
- ⚡ Fun fact: When I’m not analyzing data, you can find me experimenting in the kitchen, whipping up new recipes, binge-watching movies, or getting lost in a good novel. I believe every dish is a new creation, every film a new adventure, and every book a new world to explore!
Looking forward to connecting and collaborating!
